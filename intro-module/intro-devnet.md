In alignment with the industry, Cisco's portfolio contains a wide range of products with automation and integration opportunities. That is where Cisco DevNet comes in, DevNet is Cisco's developer network, the central resource for everything developer at Cisco.

Cisco DevNet's purpose is to teach everyone about the different Cisco API offerings and how to use them. In addition, DevNet also teaches generic coding courses such as the fundamentals of coding, introduction to Python and the introduction to REST APIs to name a few. DevNet believe that everyone can be a developer and are here to help anyone who wants to obtain those skills.

How you might ask? Everyone learns differently, so DevNet has a spectrum of resources available in order to cover the different ways of learning. DevNet's offerings include:

* **Developer documention**: A central location for all of Cisco's product's developer (API) documentation
* **Learning Labs**: Self-paced tutorials that cover a wide range of topics; starting from basic coding to using REST APIs with various Cisco techonologies
* **Video courses**: Instructor led videos teaching various topics that includes hands-on exercises
* **Sandboxes**: Production-like development and testing environments for a lot of the Cisco technologies
* **Code Exchange**: A repository of sample code written by other developers
* **Developer support**: Support for developer related issues through tickets, live chats, and forums
* **DevNet events**: Events around the world where you can find DevNet's developer advocates teaching classes on various developer topics including hands-on workshops.

The best thing about all of this is that it is **FREE**! More details on each offering will be covered later in this module.
