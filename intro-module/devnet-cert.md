## DevNet certifications

The certification program at Cisco draws on a long history of network technology exams and certifications that enable you to prove your skills and knowledge to employers and managers who want proof points for software development and design on Cisco platforms. Cisco customers see new tasks in Information Technology (IT), Operations Technology (OT), and DevOps, and application development teams have new tasks asked of them every day. They want an opportunity to show what they know, and to prove it.

That's what we're working towards here at DevNet. To read more about each certification, take a look at the [certification page on DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/), and read through each exam description:
